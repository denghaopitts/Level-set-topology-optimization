# Stress-constrained Level-set-topology-optimization
Welcome! This repository contains the MATLAB code discussed in our paper "An Efficient MATLAB Code for Stress-constrained Level Set Topology Optimization Method". The code demonstrates an efficient approach to tackle stress-constrained level set topology optimization. It's aimed at students and researchers alike, providing a practical tool to deepen understanding and facilitate further exploration in the field. Please cite our paper if you utilize this code. We hope you find it valuable in your educational or research pursuits. I've also uploaded an example using the MMA (Method of Moving Asymptotes) solver-based approach for the U-bracket problem. From several test results, it's evident that the MMA solver offers greater stability across different initializations. If users encounter instability issues, they should consider exploring this solver as an alternative
